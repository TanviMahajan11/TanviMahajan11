### Hello there, welcome to Tanviâ€™s CSCI 630 Profile

This profile is linked to my work as a student in CSCI 630 at CSU Chico.

## Contributions

1) Spearheaded in adding New TestCases for Donor.tsx (ChicoState/PantryNode#182)
2) Correctly mocked useNavigate Hook for Donors.tes (ChicoState/PantryNode#237)
3) Contributed to Write Placeholder Frontend tests by adding infrastructure to perform unit test cases for frontend codebase [test](https://github.com/ChicoState/PantryNode/pull/166)
